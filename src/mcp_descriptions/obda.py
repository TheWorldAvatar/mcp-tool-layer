OBDA_VALIDATION_DESCRIPTION = """
    Validate an OBDA mapping file using Ontop.

    The creation of OBDA file is often error prone, and this tool is used to validate the consistency between the mapping file, the ontology file and the properties file.

    To run the validation, you need to have the ontology file, the mapping file and the properties file, also the postgres database (validation database) needs to be created and populated. 

    Args:
        mapping_file (str): Path to the OBDA mapping file
        ontology_file (str): Path to the ontology file (.ttl/.owl)
        properties_file (str): Path to the DB properties file

    Returns:
        dict: Validation result with status and message

    Prerequisites: 

    1. The OBDA mapping file is created. 
    2. The ontology file (ttl file) is created. 
    3. The properties file is provided in advance. 

    """

OBDA_CREATION_DESCRIPTION = """
    Create an OBDA 2.x mapping file.

    The OBDA file is used to map tabular data in a postgres database to the ontology, allowing using SPARQL queries to query the data from relational databases. 

    To create a OBDA file, you need to first understand the schema of the tabular data and the ontology (ontology is represented by the ttl file). 

    As a result, a ttl file must be created before creating the obda file.  Also, to create a ttl file, you need to understand the schema of the tabular data. 

    As a result, for a schema file for the tabular data also must be created before creating the obda file. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    output_path : str
        Desired file location (MCP path). Created directories if necessary.
    table_name : str
        Name of the SQL table (or view) to map.
    columns : List[str]
        All column names in the table. ``id_column`` should be included but will
        not be mapped as a predicate.
    prefixes : Dict[str, str]
        Prefix â†’ IRI mapping. The default prefix (key ``""``) is mandatory.
    id_column : str, default "uuid"
        Primary-key column used to build IRIs.
    ontology_class : Optional[str]
        If provided, emits a *rdf:type* mapping to this class.
    iri_template : str, default "entity_{uuid}"
        Template for individual IRIs in the default ``:`` namespace. *Curly*
        braces must match column names.
    use_xsd_typing : bool, default False
        When *True*, each predicate object is explicitly typed as
        ``xsd:string``.

    Dependencies: 
     - A set of schema file for the tabular data, which provides the column names and their types. 
     - One ontology (ttl file) file, which provides the ontology class names and their relationships. This file need to be created by the agent first.
