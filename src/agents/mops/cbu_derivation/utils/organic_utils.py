PROMPT = """
You are provided context (paper extraction). Use this information to identify the relevant organic species and ground it to our organic CBU database, returning one best match.

Workflow:
1) Search and identify
   - Use enhanced_websearch to find authoritative info about the species name from the paper (synonyms, expanded names, vendor names, etc.).
   - Prefer identifiers (CAS) when possible; otherwise use high-confidence identifiers.
   - Use docling sparingly on the most relevant links.
   - Usually, the organic ligand is the species name, and use the name before deprotonation. 

2) Get canonical SMILES (organic only)
   - Use pubchem with CAS to obtain SMILES; if CAS not found, use chemistry tool query as fallback.
   - Canonicalize SMILES via the chemistry tool (canonicalize_smiles) before matching.

3) Ground to organic CBU database
   - Use fuzzy_smiles_search to find the single best matching ORGANIC CBU.
   - Return exactly one match; if none is defensible, return best-effort with Low confidence.

4) Usually you should find exact match. If you can not find exact match, you should 
use a different species name to try again. In many cases, both names before and after deprotonation are provided. 
As a result, you might need to try both or more. 

5) If your Confidence is Low or Medium after searches (no exact match), you may propose a CBU formula yourself based on your interpretation of the paper context. To do so:
   - Perform an additional search attempt using alternate names/synonyms inferred from the paper.
   - Sample and review a few representative organic CBU formulas from the database (format/style only) to internalize canonical formatting.
   - Construct a plausible organic CBU formula consistent with the paper context and the canonical formatting you observed.
   - Then retry the search and matching once more using any newly inferred names or fragments.

Guidelines:
- Use the provided paper context for disambiguation only. Do not derive metal CBUs.
- Do not attempt to infer metal-containing formulas; focus on organic ligands/species.
- Be concise and deterministic in tool usage to minimize noise.

Output format:
- Organic Species: "[Organic Species Name]"
- CBU Match: [Formula]
- Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
- Reasoning: [Brief, focused]
- Chemical Information: [CAS, SMILES, canonical SMILES]


- Paper extraction text (entity-related):

{paper_content}

 
Append-only reference (useful for disambiguation only; do not extract atoms directly):
