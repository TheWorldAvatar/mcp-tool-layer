EXTRACTION_SCOPE_1 = '''Extract all chemical synthesis procedures described in the article. For each procedure, extract: the name or identifier of the chemical synthesis, the explicit chemical output produced, and the document context (e.g., section or paragraph) where the synthesis is described. State clearly that the top-level entity type is ChemicalSynthesis. For each chemical output, extract its name, description, and any explicit representation as a MetalOrganicPolyhedron if mentioned. Ensure that each chemical synthesis instance is linked to only one chemical output, and that every output mentioned in the article is covered by a corresponding chemical synthesis instance.'''

EXTRACTION_SCOPE_2 = '''For each ChemicalSynthesis procedure identified, extract all chemical inputs (excluding solvents) explicitly mentioned as reactants. For each chemical input, extract: the name, all alternative names, chemical formula, detailed description (including physical properties, safety information, and usage context), purity, and any explicitly mentioned supplier. Also extract any explicit references to external material identifiers. For each chemical input, extract the ChemicalSynthesis instance it is used in. State clearly that the top-level entity type is ChemicalSynthesis.'''

EXTRACTION_SCOPE_3 = '''For each ChemicalSynthesis procedure, extract all synthesis steps in the order performed. For each step, extract: the step type (choose from Add, Stir, HeatChill, Evaporate, Sonicate, Dissolve, Crystallize, Transfer, Separate, Filter, Dry, SeparationType), the explicit order, and the ChemicalSynthesis instance it belongs to. For each step, extract all explicitly mentioned vessels and vessel environments used. For each step, extract the duration and any equipment used. For each step, extract all step-specific parameters as described in the article (e.g., for HeatChill: target temperature, temperature rate, vacuum, sealed status, stirring status, heat chill device; for Add: added chemical input, target pH, layered status, stirred status; for Evaporate: evaporation temperature, pressure, rotary evaporator, evaporated to volume, removed species; for Dry: drying agent, drying temperature, drying pressure; for Filter: washing solvent, repeated status, vacuum filtration; for Transfer: transferred amount, layered transfer, transferred to vessel; for Separate: separation solvent, separation type; for Dissolve: solvent used; for Crystallize: crystallization target temperature; for Stir: stirring temperature, wait status; for all: vessel, vessel environment, duration). State clearly that the top-level entity type is ChemicalSynthesis.'''

EXTRACTION_SCOPE_4 = '''For each ChemicalSynthesis procedure, extract all explicit information about yield (as a percentage), all equipment used (including vessels and heat chill devices), and all explicit links to the source document (e.g., section or paragraph). State clearly that the top-level entity type is ChemicalSynthesis.'''
